### Hi!

My name is John, I am an aspiring developer. I am starting this site in hopes to share cool ideas that I hope others will find useful, as well as sharing my personal experiences as I navigate my way through my undergraduate and professional career.

As a side note, this is my first attempt at writing anything for leisure, let alone for everyone to see - feedback is welcome âœ…

### Some background

I am currently attending the [University of Albany][1] as an undergraduate majoring in computer science. I hope to continue my education with a master's in the spring of next year.

In addition to attending school full time, I also work full time as a technician at [GLOBALFOUNDRIES Fab8][2]. I mainly maintain and support automation systems there, which boils down to a lot of data entry and data validation. They are assisting me with tuition, so I can't complain too much.

The company is also fantastic in allowing me a great deal of freedom with projects.
